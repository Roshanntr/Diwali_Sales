Performed a data analysis on the Diwali Sales. This data analysis explores customer purchasing behavior, identifying key demographics such as gender, age, and occupation that influence sales patterns.

**Here are the questions I was interested in answering**
1) Which age group contributes the most to overall sales, and how does their spending compare to other age groups?
2) How do spending patterns differ between men and women across various product categories?
3) Which occupations show the highest spending on products, and what are the common product categories among these occupations?
4) What are the top products generating the highest sales, and how much do they contribute to total revenue?

**I took the following steps to create my analysis :**
1) Importing the dataset and handle missing values or inconsistencies. Converting the data types (like dates or categories) and filtered out the irrelevant data.
2) Created visualizations (bar plots, histograms, pie charts) to identify patterns in sales across age groups, gender, and occupation.
Used groupby() functions to calculate total sales for specific groups like gender, age, and occupation.
3)Summarizing the key findings, such as target customer profiles and actionable business insights

**Here are my key takeaways :**

a) The age group 26-35 years contributes the most to overall sales, significantly outspending other age groups. Their spending is the highest across multiple product categories.
b) Women spend more than men across most product categories, especially in areas like clothing, electronics, and food.
c) Customers working in IT, Healthcare, and Aviation industries have the highest spending. These customers commonly purchase electronics, food, and clothing.
d) The top products are primarily in categories like electronics, clothing, and food, and they significantly contribute to a large portion of the total revenue, with clear dominance in the sales chart.
